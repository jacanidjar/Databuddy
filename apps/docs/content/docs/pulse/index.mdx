## Why Databuddy Pulse is Your New Reliability Co-Pilot

### Integrated Reliability

Uptime monitoring is no longer a silo. See your uptime status, RUM data, and Core Web Vitals all in one dashboard.

**Unified View:** The only platform that bundles privacy-first analytics with proactive monitoring.

### Developer-First Speed

Get alerted the moment an issue is detected with 30-second check intervals and multi-protocol support (HTTP/S, Ping, Port).

**High-Performance:** Built on Go/Rust and ClickHouse for low-latency checks and high-volume data processing.

### No More False Alarms

Our multi-location check and N-out-of-M rule filters out transient network noise, so you only get paged when it's a real problem.

**Intelligent Alerting:** Reduces alert fatigue with a built-in false positive reduction strategy.

### Seamless Automation

Use our powerful Webhooks to instantly trigger automated workflows in Slack, PagerDuty, or your custom incident management system.

**API-First:** Webhooks and a full REST API for complete control and integration into your CI/CD pipeline.
