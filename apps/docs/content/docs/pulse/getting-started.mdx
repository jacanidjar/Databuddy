This guide will help you set up your first uptime monitor with Databuddy Pulse in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Create Your First Monitor

1. Go to [app.databuddy.cc](https://app.databuddy.cc)
2. Navigate to the **Pulse** section in your dashboard
3. Click **Create Monitor**
4. Enter your website URL or endpoint
5. Choose your check type (HTTP/S, Ping, or Port)

</Step>
<Step>

## Configure Monitor Settings

Set up your monitor with the following options:

- **Check Interval:** Choose between 1-minute (Pro) or 5-minute (Free) intervals
- **Protocol:** HTTP/HTTPS, Ping, or Port checks
- **Locations:** Select multiple check locations for redundancy
- **Alert Rules:** Configure N-out-of-M rules to reduce false positives

</Step>
<Step>

## Set Up Alerting

Configure how you want to be notified:

1. **Email Alerts:** Get notified instantly when downtime is detected
2. **Webhooks:** Integrate with Slack, PagerDuty, or your custom system
3. **API Access:** Use our REST API for custom integrations

<Callout type="info">
  **Pro Tip:** Use webhooks to trigger automated incident response workflows in your CI/CD pipeline.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

## Monitor Your Status

Once configured, your monitor will start checking immediately:

1. **View Real-Time Status** - See current uptime status in your dashboard
2. **Check Response Times** - Monitor latency across all check locations
3. **Review Incident History** - Track downtime events and resolution times
4. **Integrate with Analytics** - See uptime data alongside your RUM metrics

<Callout type="success">
  Your monitor is now active! You'll receive alerts the moment an issue is detected.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Monitor Types

### HTTP/HTTPS Monitors

Perfect for monitoring web applications and APIs:

- **Status Code Checks:** Verify your endpoint returns expected status codes
- **Response Time Monitoring:** Track latency and performance
- **SSL Certificate Monitoring:** Get alerts before certificates expire
- **Keyword Matching:** Verify specific content appears in responses

### Ping Monitors

Monitor server availability and network connectivity:

- **ICMP Ping:** Check basic network connectivity
- **Response Time Tracking:** Monitor latency to your servers
- **Packet Loss Detection:** Identify network issues

### Port Monitors

Verify specific ports are accessible:

- **TCP Port Checks:** Ensure services are listening on expected ports
- **Connection Timeout Monitoring:** Detect slow or unresponsive services
- **Service Availability:** Monitor databases, Redis, and other services

## Alert Configuration

### N-out-of-M Rules

Reduce false positives by requiring multiple failures before alerting:

- **Example:** Alert only if 2 out of 3 locations fail
- **Benefit:** Filters out transient network issues
- **Result:** Only real problems trigger alerts

### Multi-Location Checks

Monitor from multiple geographic locations:

- **Global Coverage:** Check from US, EU, and Asia-Pacific regions
- **Redundancy:** Ensure issues aren't location-specific
- **Accuracy:** Get a true picture of your service availability

## Webhook Integration

Set up automated workflows with webhooks:

<CodeBlock
  language="json"
  filename="webhook-payload-example.json"
  code={`{
  "event": "monitor.down",
  "monitor": {
    "id": "mon_123",
    "name": "Production API",
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "status": "down"
  },
  "incident": {
    "id": "inc_456",
    "started_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "duration": 120
  },
  "check": {
    "location": "us-east-1",
    "response_time": null,
    "status_code": null,
    "error": "Connection timeout"
  }
}`}
/>

### Slack Integration

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="slack-webhook.sh"
  code={`curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  -d '{
    "text": "🚨 Monitor {{monitor.name}} is DOWN",
    "blocks": [
      {
        "type": "section",
        "text": {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "*Monitor:* {{monitor.name}}\\n*URL:* {{monitor.url}}\\n*Status:* {{monitor.status}}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'`}
/>

### PagerDuty Integration

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="pagerduty-webhook.sh"
  code={`curl -X POST https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  -d '{
    "routing_key": "YOUR_ROUTING_KEY",
    "event_action": "trigger",
    "payload": {
      "summary": "Monitor {{monitor.name}} is DOWN",
      "source": "{{monitor.url}}",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  }'`}
/>

## API Integration

Use our REST API to programmatically manage monitors:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="create-monitor.sh"
  code={`curl -X POST https://api.databuddy.cc/v1/monitors \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "name": "Production API",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "type": "http",
    "interval": 60,
    "locations": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"],
    "alert_rules": {
      "n_out_of_m": {
        "n": 2,
        "m": 3
      }
    }
  }'`}
/>

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Critical Endpoints** - Monitor your most important services first
2. **Use Multiple Locations** - Ensure checks aren't affected by regional issues
3. **Configure N-out-of-M Rules** - Reduce false positives from transient issues
4. **Set Up Webhooks** - Automate incident response workflows
5. **Monitor Response Times** - Track performance trends, not just uptime
6. **Review Incident History** - Learn from past incidents to prevent future ones

## Troubleshooting

**Not receiving alerts?**

1. **Check Alert Settings** - Verify your email/webhook configuration
2. **Review Alert Rules** - Ensure N-out-of-M rules aren't too strict
3. **Test Webhooks** - Use the test button in dashboard to verify webhook delivery
4. **Check Spam Folder** - Email alerts might be filtered

**False positives?**

1. **Increase N-out-of-M** - Require more failures before alerting
2. **Add More Locations** - More check locations provide better accuracy
3. **Review Check Intervals** - Longer intervals reduce transient noise
4. **Check Network Conditions** - Verify your endpoint isn't rate-limiting checks
